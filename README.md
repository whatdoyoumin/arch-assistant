For Categorization and Cataloguing of Historical Artifact Data

Problem Statement: 50,000 artifacts in unstructured text and csv data, the AI will assist to catalogue each artifact into its decoration technique, thereby saving man-hours needed to train a domain expert to manually search and catalogue the data.
The LLM will sort the data into different categories, thereby increasing the searchability and organization of the data.
We will also use Retrieval Augmented Generation to augment the knowledge base to be a domain expert in classifying artifacts based on knowledge bases such as Books and Glossary of Getty AAT terms.

The Application is deployed on ECS Fargate on a AWS Sandbox.
