Problem Statement: 50,000 artifacts in unstructured text and csv data, the AI will assist to catalogue each artifact into its decoration technique, thereby saving man-hours needed to manually catalogue the data.
We will also use Retrieval Augmented Generation to augment the knowledge base to be a domain expert in classifying artifacts based on knowledge bases such as Books and Glossary of Getty AAT terms.
